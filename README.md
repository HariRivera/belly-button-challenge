## Description
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive application designed to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. This dataset reveals that a small number of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) are present in more than 70% of people, while the rest are relatively rare. The purpose of this project is to visualize these data and make it easy to explore the diversity of microbial life in human belly buttons.

## Features
- **Bar Chart**: Displays the top 10 OTUs found in the selected sample, providing a quick overview of the most prevalent microbes in that individual.
- **Bubble Chart**: Visualizes all OTUs in the selected sample, with bubble size representing the abundance of each OTU and bubble color representing different OTUs. This chart offers a comprehensive view of the microbial diversity within a single sample.
- **Metadata**: Shows demographic information of the individual associated with the selected sample, including factors like age, gender, and location, which can provide context to the microbial data.

## Technologies Used
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/): A powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations.
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/): A graphing library that makes interactive, publication-quality graphs online.

## Project Context
The Belly Button Biodiversity project highlights the incredible diversity of microbial life that exists in human navels. Understanding this microbial diversity is crucial for studying human health, as some microbes play beneficial roles, while others can be pathogenic. This dashboard makes the dataset accessible and interactive, allowing users to delve into the specifics of microbial presence and distribution across different individuals.

## Deployment
